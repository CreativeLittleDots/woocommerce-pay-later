<h2 id="woocommercepaylaterpaymentgateway">WooCommerce Pay Later Payment Gateway</h2>

<p>A Payment Gateway for WooCommerce that allows Customers to Pay Later at Checkout.</p>

<p>After a Customer has checked via Pay Later, the Customer is directed to the Order Received page and is sent an invoice using the built in WooCommerce Customer Invoice email.</p>

<p>There is a filter you can use called <strong>wc_pay_later_order_received_url</strong> to direct to a custom page if you&#8217;d prefer to direct the Customer to a different page:</p>

<pre><code class="php">apply_filters( 'wc_pay_later_order_received_url', $order-&gt;get_checkout_order_received_url(), $order, $this )
</code></pre>

<p>Which can be used in functions.php like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">add_filter( 'wc_pay_later_order_received_url', 'redirect_to_custom_page', 10, 3 );

function redirect_to_custom_page( $url, $order, $gateway ) {
    
    return add_query_arg(array(
        'order_id' =&gt; $order-&gt;id,
        'gateway_id' =&gt; $gateway-&gt;id,
        'some_arbitrary' =&gt; 'text'
    ), 'http://somedomain.com');
    
    // results in a redirect to http://somedomain.com?order_id={{order_id}}&amp;gateway_id=pay_later&amp;some_arbitrary=text
    
}
</code></pre>

<p>Orders that are checked out via Pay Later result in the status of <strong>pending</strong>. Customers can pay for the Order by clicking the <strong>Pay button</strong> in their My Account &gt; Orders area.</p>
